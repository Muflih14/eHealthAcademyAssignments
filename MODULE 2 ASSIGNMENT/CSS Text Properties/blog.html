                <h3>History, Importance and Dates</h3>
                <p>A festival is a day or period of the year when people put their various businesses on hold to celebrate a special<br>
                  event which is often a religious or traditional event. In Nigeria, these events include Christmas, Eyo festival, one <br>
                  Lagos fiesta and other celebrations. Everybody is always excited on such day, although there are bound to be plenty <br>
                  of hawkers and food sellers. Most shops in Lagos state usually close very early because it’s the ADAMU-ORISA (Eyo) <br>
                  Festival. This is perhaps the most famous festival in Lagos state as it was first staged in 1854 in the honour of the late <br>
                  Oba Akintoye of Lagos.

                <h3> Eyo Festival dates </h3>
                This festival has been celebrated on the following dates in Lagos, Nigeria:
                <ul>
                  <li>November 26, 2011 – It was celebrated to remember Prince Yesufu Abiodun Oniru, a nobleman in Lagos state. </li>
                  <li>May 20, 2017 – It was celebrated to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lagos state. This event was tagged Lagos@50.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Its Importance to the People of Lagos </h3>
                The cultural significance of the Eyo festival is its usage in the funeral of a king(Obas) or chiefs. It is also a necessity<br>
                for crowning a new king or giving out a high-level chieftaincy title in Lagos state.<br>

                As a mark of duty, a newly crowned Oba in Lagos performs some rituals during the Eyo festival to appease his dead predecessors <br>
                for the success of his own reign/tenure as King. After the Eyo festival, it is the belief of the people of Lagos that this <br>
                festival has taken away death, sickness, lack, suffering and has brought wealth, good life, prosperity and other good desires of Lagosians.</p>
