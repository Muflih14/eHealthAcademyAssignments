        Nobody’s born <strong>smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s</strong> good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong><em>Shakespeare</em></strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <strong><em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em></strong><br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your <strong>brain a little bit stronger.</strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <em>You just don’t get it, yet</em>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to <strong>know one thing:</strong><br>
        <em>You can learn anything</em>.
